# Penetration-Testing---Linux-and-Windows-Vulnerable-Machines
Penetration test of two vulnerable machines, one a Linux machine and one a Windows machine. Went through a full penetration testing process for each machine including: Planning and Scoping, Information gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Maintaining Access, and House Cleaning. Each machine contained hidden flags which I found using a wide variety of pen testing methods and technologies.

System 192.168.10.104(Windows machine) - 8 total flags
