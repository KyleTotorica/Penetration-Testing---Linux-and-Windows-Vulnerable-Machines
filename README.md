# Penetration-Testing---Linux-and-Windows-Vulnerable-Machines
Penetration test of two vulnerable machines, one a Linux machine and one a Windows machine. Went through a full penetration testing process for each machine including: Planning and Scoping, Information gathering, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation, Maintaining Access, and House Cleaning. Each machine contained hidden flags which I found using a wide variety of pen testing methods and technologies. 

Vulnerable Machines- 
System 192.168.10.104(Windows machine) - 8 total flags
System 192.168.10.100(Linux Machine - 11 total flags

Attached in this repo is a document containing all of the flags that I was able to capture in both of these machines as well as breif descriptions of methods used to discover them

The other document provides a full Penetration Assessment document that documents the full penetration test step by step going through the actions that I took at each step of the pen test. The document begins with a high level summary with a summary of the test as well as the test objectives and requirements. It then completely cover all of the methodologies and techniques that I used through every step of the testing process breaking down each steo for both of the vulnerable machines. It then goes into listing each of the vulnerabiliites that were discovered along with the vulnerabilities CVE and CVSS score if available. Following the section on vulnerabilities, the report also contains higher level information for stakeholders in more non technical terms. Including a section with recommendations going forward to patch or fix the found vulnerabilites.
